    <h1>citizenship</h1>
    <p> I do believe that honesty, compassion, respect, responsibility, and courage are all values and necessary components to have in order to be a good citizen.

The definition of citizenship from the dictionary is, the character of an individual viewed as a member of society; behavior in terms of the duties, obligations, and functions of a citizen.

Honesty: truthfulness, sincerity, or frankness. Honesty is important because honesty keeps people from lying, and keeps people doing the right thing.

Respect: deference to a right, privilege, privileged position, or someone or something considered to have certain rights or privileges; proper acceptance or courtesy; acknowledgment. Respect is important because respect helps make sure that everybody is treating others the way they want to be treated.

Responsibility: a particular burden of obligation upon one who is responsible. Responsibility is important because it makes sure that everybody is taking care of what they need to get done in a timely manner.

Compassion: a feeling of deep sympathy and sorrow for another who is stricken by misfortune, accompanied by a strong desire to alleviate the suffering.  Compassion is important because it makes sure that everyone is caring for one another.

Courage: the quality of mind or spirit that enables a person to face difficulty, danger, pain, etc., without fear; bravery.  Courage is important because it helps people step outside their comfort zone and try new things. Another component of being a good citizen includes being considerate. This is because being considerate of others is important because it helps make sure everyone is looking out and helping one another be the best they can be. The most recent act of citizenship I did was

helping my sister out and giving her the advice she needed in order to solve the problem she had.
